## Intention of the Project

AstroLinkHub allows you to create a customizable links page for free, using your preferred colors and credits. Easily update it using JSON.


## Technologies Used

The project has been developed using the following technologies:

- **Astro**: An open source web application development framework based on TypeScript. .
- **CSS**: Used to style and design web pages.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language based on JavaScript that adds additional features, such as static typing, providing greater robustness to the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **html** -> Edit language, title, description and favicon (replace it in `/public`).
- **background** -> Use the same color twice for a solid color or use two colors for a gradient color.
- **header** -> Edit your image (replace it in `/public`), name and description.
- **socials** -> Add more icons with your socials URL (see the networks available).
- **featured** -> Highlight links with a background image or color (same as buttons).
- **buttons** -> Add more buttons with your socials URL (see the networks available).
- **footer** -> Edit the copyright and URL of the developer.
