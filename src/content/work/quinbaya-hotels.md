> I want to thank my teacher Juan Jose Gallego, for helping us to create this project, his patience to teach and his knowledge.

## Intention of the Project

This project originated from a course project while studying at CESDE. I intended to create an Airbnb-type page with a connection to an API to perform CRUD operations for reservations and to create reservations through forms. This was entirely developed in Angular with TypeScript to ensure better organization of components.


## Technologies Used

The project has been developed using the following technologies:

- **Angular**: An open source web application development framework based on TypeScript. Angular allows creating single page applications (SPA) in an efficient and scalable way.
- **HTML**: Used to define the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS**: Used to style and design web pages.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language based on JavaScript that adds additional features, such as static typing, providing greater robustness to the code.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `app/`: This folder contains the source code of the Angular application.
- `docs/`: Here you will find additional documentation related to the project.
- `tests/`: This folder contains the test files for the code.
- `README.md`: This file, which you are currently reading, provides general information about the repository.
